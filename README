An OrderedSet is a custom MutableSet that remembers its order, so that every
entry has an index that can be looked up.

Based on a recipe originally posted to ActiveState Recipes by Raymond Hettiger,
and released under the MIT license:

Rob Speer's changes are as follows:

    - changed the content from a doubly-linked list to a regular Python list.
      Seriously, who wants O(1) deletes but O(N) lookups by index?
    - add() returns the index of the added item
    - index() just returns the index of an item
    - added a __getstate__ and __setstate__ so it can be pickled
    - added __getitem__

Evan Callicoat's changes:
    - implemented discard() so removal of items is possible
